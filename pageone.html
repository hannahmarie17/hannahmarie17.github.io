<p>Welcome to my About Me page!</p>
<p>I am currently a student at the University of Maine Orono.</p>
<p>When I first came to the University, I was an anthropology major. After my first semester here, I realized I was better suited for something in the business world. This is why I am now a business management major! I am planning on continuing to add to this major as I learn more about myself and what I enjoy doing!</p>
<p>I never thought I would be pursing a major such as this, but I have so far really enjoyed it! This is my first time coding, and I think it is super interesting! I hope I can continue to grow as a student in order to pursue an enjoyable career in my future.</p>
